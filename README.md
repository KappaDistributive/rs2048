![rs2048 interface](https://github.com/KappaDistributive/rs2048/blob/master/assets/rs2048.png)

A clone of 2048 written in Rust. Use the arrow keys to move and R to reset.

This is work in progress but if you want to jump right in, take a look at this [demo](https://kappadistributive.github.io/rs2048/).

#  Running the application
